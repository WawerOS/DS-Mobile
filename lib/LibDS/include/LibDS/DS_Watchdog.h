 * to prevent it from elapsing, or "timing out".
 * If, due to a hardware fault or program error, the program fails to restart the
 * watchdog, the timer will elapse and generate a timeout signal.
 *
 * The timeout signal is used to initiate corrective action or actions.
 * The corrective actions typically include placing the computer system in a
 * safe state and restoring normal system operation.
