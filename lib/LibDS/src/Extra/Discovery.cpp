         *
         * REASON:
         *
         * - Third party libraries have some issues with Qt.
         *   For example, they may change "roboRIO-XXYY.local" to
         *   "roborio-XXYY.local" and (sometimes) this may cause a failure.
         *   I have seen this behaviour with Mac OS X 10.11
         * - mDNS is not available on Windows, this can be solved by
         *   downloading and installing Bonjour, but this is an additional step
         *   for the users
         * - mDNS is not available on Android, there is no easy way to implement
         *   a Android library with Qt...it would be easier to reinvent the wheel
         *   and provide our own way to use mDNS
         * - I haven't tested on Windows Phone, but my hopes for it to support
         *   mDNS are pretty low
